# Dog a Day CRM Card

This is my first test project for HubSpot developer projects crm cards. This repo contains code to validate my learning of the UI Cards concepts in a cute and not relevant at all way. These crm cards pull from the public [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) and display pictures of dogs on demand.

## Requirements
There are a few things that must be set up before you can make use of this.
- You must have an active HubSpot account.
- You must have the [HubSpot CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hubspot/cli) installed and set up.
- You must have access to developer projects (developer projects are currently [in public beta under "CRM Development Tools"](https://app.hubspot.com/l/whats-new/betas)).

## Usage
The HubSpot CLI is configured to pull from the latest release of this project. To get started, run the following CLI command in your terminal:

`hs project create`

The CLI should walk you throug the rest of the setup flow.
